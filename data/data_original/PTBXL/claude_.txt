Claude, create ptbxl labels.csv 

Maps SNOMED codes to class labels:

Uses your custom mapping from PTBXL_class_labels.csv
Handles multiple SNOMED codes per record (comma-separated)
Assigns the first matching code found in your mapping
Defaults to class 6 ("Other arrhythmias") for unmatched codes



Results Summary:

Total records: 999 files processed
Class distribution:

Class 0 (Sinus Rhythm - Normal): 748 samples (74.9%)
Class 2 (T-wave abnormal): 116 samples (11.6%)
Class 3 (Atrial Fibrillation): 49 samples (4.9%)
Class 4 (1st degree AV block): 23 samples (2.3%)
Class 5 (Left anterior fascicular block): 10 samples (1.0%)
Class 6 (Other arrhythmias): 53 samples (5.3%)



The output labels.csv file will contain columns: filename, file_number, Age, Sex, Dx, and class_label (0-6).
Note that Class 1 (Left-axis Deviation) has 0 samples in your dataset, which means none of the SNOMED code "397320003" appeared in the Dx field of your G1 data.
Would you like me to help you with the next step of adapting your 1D CNN model for this PTBXL dataset?
