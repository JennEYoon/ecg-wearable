### Conversation with Gemini
I use my Github repo to store all notes and PDF documents related to my project as well as code, is this a bad idea? How else can I store my project related documents? Also I have many notebooks where I conduct experiments, but only a few of them will make it to the final model notebooks. How else can I store the experiments and any final notebooks? I like to view the working documents from a browser on my iPad when I am not on my computer. Github allows me to view all of my documents. But I also have Google Drive files that can be viewed using a browser. However, any .ipynb notebook does not renden when it's in the Google Drive, so it's easier to view them from a Github repo. I am working alone on my repo. Currently I have one public repo. Should the repo be used to develop code only instead of storing most of my related files and thinking notes?

### Rethinking Your All-in-One GitHub Workflow: A Guide to Streamlined Project Management

While the convenience of a single GitHub repository for all your project-related code, notes, and documents is appealing, it can lead to disorganization, a bloated repository, and inefficiencies in the long run. As a solo developer, establishing good habits for project organization now will pay dividends as your projects grow in complexity. This guide will explore the drawbacks of your current approach and offer a more structured and sustainable workflow for managing your projects, with a focus on accessibility from your iPad.

#### The Pitfalls of a Monolithic Repository

Using a single public GitHub repository for everything from source code to personal notes and large PDF documents presents several challenges:

  * **Repository Bloat:** Git is designed to handle text-based files efficiently, but it struggles with large binary files like PDFs. Storing these directly in your repository will significantly increase its size, making it slow to clone and work with. While Git LFS (Large File Storage) can mitigate this, it adds another layer of complexity to your workflow.
  * **Lack of Separation of Concerns:** Mixing core project code with experimental notebooks, project documentation, and personal notes creates a cluttered and confusing project structure. It becomes difficult to distinguish between production-ready code and exploratory work.
  * **Limited Search and Discovery:** While GitHub's search is powerful for code, it's not optimized for a knowledge base. Finding specific information within a sea of varied file types can be cumbersome.
  * **Suboptimal Viewing Experience for Non-Code Files:** As you've noted, while GitHub renders Markdown files and `.ipynb` notebooks reasonably well in a browser, the experience for other file formats like PDFs is not ideal for reading and annotation on an iPad.

#### A More Structured Approach: Separating Code, Documents, and Experiments

A more effective approach is to separate your project components into dedicated storage solutions that are best suited for their respective types. Here’s a recommended workflow:

**1. Code and Final Notebooks: The Role of Your GitHub Repository**

Your GitHub repository should be the central hub for your project's *code* and *final, presentation-ready notebooks*. This is what GitHub excels at: version control, collaboration (even with your future self), and showcasing your finished work.

  * **Project Structure:** For your data science projects, consider adopting a standardized project structure. A popular choice is the [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science) template. This provides a well-defined directory structure that separates raw data, processed data, notebooks, source code, and final reports. A typical structure might look like this:

    ```
    ├── data/
    │   ├── raw/          # Raw, immutable data
    │   └── processed/    # Cleaned and transformed data
    ├── docs/             # Project documentation
    ├── notebooks/
    │   ├── exploratory/  # Your experimental notebooks
    │   └── final/        # Cleaned, final notebooks
    ├── reports/
    │   └── figures/      # Generated plots and figures
    └── src/
        ├── data/         # Scripts to download or generate data
        ├── features/     # Scripts to create features for modeling
        └── models/       # Scripts to train and evaluate models
    ```

  * **Final Notebooks:** The `notebooks/final/` directory should contain the polished notebooks that represent the core findings of your project. These should be well-documented, with clear explanations and visualizations, suitable for sharing or presenting.

**2. Experimental Notebooks: A Space for Exploration**

Your numerous experimental notebooks are a crucial part of the research and development process. However, they don't all belong in the main branch of your project's repository. Here are a couple of strategies for managing them:

  * **A Dedicated `exploratory` Directory:** As shown in the project structure above, you can have an `exploratory` subdirectory within your `notebooks` folder. This keeps your experimental work alongside your project but clearly separated from the final outputs. You can use a naming convention to track your experiments, for example: `YYYY-MM-DD_experiment-name.ipynb`.
  * **A Separate, Private "Lab" Repository:** For a cleaner separation, you could create a separate, private GitHub repository named something like `my-project-lab`. This can be your digital sandbox for all your exploratory work, without cluttering your main project repository.

**3. Project Documents and Notes: Your Digital Knowledge Base**

For your project-related notes, thinking documents, and PDFs, a dedicated knowledge base or document management tool will serve you far better than a Git repository. These tools are designed for easy organization, rich text editing, and seamless browser-based access on your iPad. Here are some excellent options:

  * **Notion:** A highly flexible and popular choice that acts as an all-in-one workspace. You can create databases to track your projects, embed PDFs and web content, write notes using a powerful editor, and even create simple websites. Its mobile and web apps provide a great viewing experience on the iPad.
  * **Obsidian:** A powerful, Markdown-based knowledge base that stores your notes as local files. This gives you ownership of your data and allows you to use Git to version control your notes if you wish. Obsidian has excellent support for linking your thoughts and creating a "second brain." Its mobile app is also very capable.
  * **Google Drive:** As you're already using it, Google Drive remains a viable option for storing PDFs and other documents. The key to overcoming the `.ipynb` rendering issue is to use **Google Colaboratory**. You can open notebooks stored in your Google Drive directly in Colab for viewing, editing, and execution, all within your iPad's browser.

#### Viewing Documents on Your iPad: A Seamless Experience

Your requirement to view documents on your iPad is a key consideration. Here's how the recommended tools stack up:

  * **GitHub:** While you can view repositories on your iPad's browser, the experience is optimized for code. Viewing PDFs is essentially a download-and-open-in-another-app process. Markdown files and notebooks are rendered, but without the rich editing and organizational features of other tools.
  * **Notion, and Obsidian (with sync):** These services have dedicated iPad apps and excellent web interfaces that make viewing and editing your notes and embedded documents (like PDFs) a smooth and intuitive experience.
  * **Google Drive with Colab:** This combination is a powerful solution for your notebooks. You can organize your project folders in Google Drive and then open any `.ipynb` file in Colab for a full-fledged notebook experience in your iPad's browser. For PDFs in Google Drive, the native viewer is excellent for reading and annotating.

#### Should Your Repo Be for Code Only?

Yes, for the most part. Your primary, public-facing repository should be dedicated to the code, final notebooks, and essential documentation (like a well-crafted `README.md`) that another developer would need to understand and run your project. Your experimental work, extensive notes, and large data files are better managed in separate, dedicated systems.

By adopting a more structured approach, you'll create a more organized, efficient, and scalable workflow that will serve you well as your projects evolve. You'll have the best of both worlds: the power of Git for your code and the flexibility of dedicated tools for your documentation and exploratory work, all accessible from your computer and your iPad.
